## What is our mission?

Our mission is very simple. On our Discord server, there are free games that other game makers give, and we will notify you all the free games that will come in the future. And we have a lot more things you will want to check out on our Discord server. So come check it out! You don't lose anything if you see it yourself. And we have a good community; people are friendly there, and we like to help people with their problems with anything on your computer. ;) We all welcome you to be part of our community!
